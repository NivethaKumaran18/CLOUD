1) Diffie Hellman Algorithm

Aim:
 	To implement diffie hellman algorithm using HTML and javascript.

Algorithm:

Step 1: Let us consider that both Alice and Bob are sharing the same public keys g and p. 
Step 2:	Alice selects a random public key a.
Step 3: Then he computes his secret key A as g to the power a(mod p).
Step 4: Then Alice sends the secret ket A to Bob
Step 5: In the same way, Bob also selects a public key b and computes his secret key as B and sends the same back to Alice.
Step 6:	Finally,both of them compute their common secret key as the other oneâ€™s secret key power of a mod p.




2)One Time Pad(otp):

Aim:
	To implement One Time Pad cipher using Java.

Algorithm:

Step 1: The plain text and the random keys are read as input.
Step 2: In this algorithm, both the plain text and key must be same in size.
Step 3: For Encryption, the cipher text is generated by doing bit by bit XOR of the plain text with the key.
Step 4: For Decryption, the plain text is generated in the same way by doing bit by bit XOR of the cipher text with the shared one time key.
